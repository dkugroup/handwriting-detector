# HandwrittenDigitRecognizer
This repository will be for training a model which recognize handwritten digits using scikit-learn and Support Vector Machines.



Handwriting recognition (HWR), also known as Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), is the ability of a computer to receive and interpret intelligible handwritten input from sources such as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens and other devices. The image of the written text may be sensed "off line" from a piece of paper by optical scanning (optical character recognition) or intelligent word recognition.
